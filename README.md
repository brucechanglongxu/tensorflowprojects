# TensorFlow Projects: Developing Deep Intuition

This repository is dedicated to developing a deep, conceptual understanding of TensorFlow through hands-on implementation. TensorFlow is far more than a machine learning library—it is a computational framework for expressing complex tensor-based operations, enabling large-scale differentiation, optimization, and deployment across heterogeneous systems. At its core, TensorFlow represents computations as symbolic graphs, where each node defines an operation and each edge carries multidimensional data. This abstraction allows for not only efficient execution, but also introspection into the mathematical structure of models, enabling flexibility far beyond black-box training pipelines.

Most tutorials and libraries focus on high-level APIs to quickly build and train models. While useful, this often obscures the fundamental mechanics of how tensors flow—how operations are staged, gradients are accumulated, and training is orchestrated across time and space. This repository seeks to reverse that trend. Each project within is a lens into TensorFlow’s internal logic, uncovering how its graph execution model enables powerful and expressive neural computations. Through these examples, we study how layers compose into differentiable systems, how loss landscapes shape learning trajectories, and how constraints, sparsity, and structure can be modeled within the same framework.

The goal is not just to build models that work, but to build an intuition for why they work, how TensorFlow enables that behavior, and what tools it offers for debugging, visualization, and optimization. Whether through solving puzzles like Sudoku, defining custom training loops, or reimplementing core mechanisms from first principles, this repository is a space for reflection, experimentation, and mastery. It treats TensorFlow as both a language for expressing computation and a canvas for deep learning design.
